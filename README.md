A model to predict the state of the rockets to be able to adjust costs dynamically based on data from various sensors and their state.

## The solution

This multi-class classification problem is solved with an initial variable correlation analysis, and a Random Forest classifier followed by a search of the best hyperparams to predict the class.
It is also implemented a neural network that solves the problem pretty well.
